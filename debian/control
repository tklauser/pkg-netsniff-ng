Description: Linux network packet sniffer toolkit
 netsniff-ng is a high performance Linux network sniffer for packet inspection.
 It can be used for protocol analysis, reverse engineering or network
 debugging. The gain of performance is reached by 'zero-copy' mechanisms, so
 that the kernel does not need to copy packets from kernelspace to userspace.
 .
 netsniff-ng toolkit currently consists of the following utilities:
 .
  * netsniff-ng: the zero-copy sniffer, pcap capturer and replayer itself.
  * astraceroute: an autonomous system trace route and DPI testing utility.
  * bpfc: a tiny Berkeley Packet Filter compiler supporting Linux extensions.
  * curvetun: a lightweight curve25519-based multiuser IP tunnel.
  * flowtop: a top-like netfilter connection tracking tool.
  * ifpps: a top-like kernel networking and system statistics tool.
  * mausezahn: a fast versatile packet generator with Cisco-cli.
  * trafgen: a high performance zero-copy network packet generator.
